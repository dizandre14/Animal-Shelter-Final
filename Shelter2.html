        <p style="text-emphasis-color: orangered">According to <a href="https://pawsomeadvice.com/pets/animal-shelter-statistics/" target="_blank">Pawsomeadvice.com</a><br><br>Approximately 3 million animals are euthanized each year with 80% of them being fully healthy and treatable. But if you think that's a lot then you should have seen the numbers from the 1980's, because the numbers then were about 17 million...Luckily our society has grown much more compassion since then and with no-kill shelters becoming more prevalent hopefully those numbers continue upwards...And that's where YOU come in.<br><br>
        
        Our mission is to help spread awareness about the killings in animal shelters and help spread the use of no-kill shelters instead so for that we need your help, if you can take a little time out of your day to donate or at least spread the word of the tragic slayings that takes place within these shelters we can continue to save the lives of these innocent animals.<br><br>
            
        If you have any questions about supporting or want to donate, please go to our contact page to get in touch with us.</p>
